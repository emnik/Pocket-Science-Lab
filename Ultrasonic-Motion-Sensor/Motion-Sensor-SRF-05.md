##HY-SRF05 Ultrasonic Position Sensor
Ultrasonic sensors overcome many of the weaknesses of IR sensors - they provide distance measurement regardless of color and lighting of obstacles. They also provide lower minimum distances and wider angles of detection to gaurantee that obstacles are not missed by a narrow sensor beam.


The SRF05 has been designed to increase flexibility, increase range, and to reduce costs still further. As such, the SRF05 is fully compatible with the SRF04. Range is increased from 3 meters to 4 meters. A new operating mode (tying the mode pin to ground) allows the SRF05 to use a single pin for both trigger and echo, thereby saving valuable pins on your controller. When the mode pin is left unconnected, the SRF05 operates with separate trigger and echo pins, like the SRF04. The SRF05 includes a small delay before the echo pulse to give slower controllers such as the Basic Stamp and Picaxe time to execute their pulse in commands.
