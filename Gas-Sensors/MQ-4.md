### MQ-4 Methane CNG gas sensor
This methane gas sensor detects the concentration of methane gas in the air and ouputs its reading as an analog voltage. 
The concentration sensing range of 300 ppm to 10,000 ppm is suitable for leak detection. 
For example, the sensor could detect if someone left a gas stove on but not lit. 
The sensor can operate at temperatures from -10 to 50Â°C and consumes less than 150 mA at 5 V.



This sensor has a high sensitivity and fast response time. The sensor's output is an analog resistance.
