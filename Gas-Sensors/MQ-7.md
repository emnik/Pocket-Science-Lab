### Carbon Monoxide Sensor MQ-7
This Carbon Monoxide (CO) gas sensor detects the concentrations of CO in the air and ouputs its reading as an analog voltage. The sensor can measure concentrations of 10 to 10,000 ppm.
The sensor can operate at temperatures from -10 to 50Â°C and consumes less than 150 mA at 5 V
