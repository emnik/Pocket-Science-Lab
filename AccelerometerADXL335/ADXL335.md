## Analog acceleration sensor module using ADXL335 - GY-61
GY-61 is a small, thin, low power, complete three-axis accelerometer voltage output through the signal conditioning at a minimum of full scale Â± 3 g measurement range acceleration. It can measure the tilt-sensing applications in the static acceleration of gravity, and movement, shock or vibration due to dynamic acceleration.
