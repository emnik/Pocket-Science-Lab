## Pocket-Science-Lab
This repository hosts the programs developed for my **GSoC-2015** Project.
Project Title: **"Sensor Plug-ins, Add-on devices and GUI Improvements for ExpEYES"** (https://goo.gl/UZea4c)
Mentor Organization: **FOSSASIA** (http://fossasia.org/)
Mentors: Mario Behling, Hong Phuc and Rebentisch

This Repository is also intended for hosting programs to conduct science experiments using Free Software and Open Hardware frameworks like **ExpEYES** (www.expeyes.in), **MicroHope** (www.microhope.org) and other open source tools. It is also intended to host documentation related to designing computer interfaced science experiments using low-cost sensors and home-made apparatus.
