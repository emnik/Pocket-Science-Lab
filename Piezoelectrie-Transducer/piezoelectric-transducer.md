 **A Piezoelectric transducer** is a device that uses the piezoelectric effect to measure pressure, acceleration, strain or force by converting them to an electrical charge

These devices can be used both as sensors and actuators, so they're referred to as transducers, a term applied to any device that can convert one form of energy to another. The sensor turns mechanical energy into electric potential, and the actuator converts electrical energy into mechanical force or motion.

The Piezoelectric material used here, ceramic lead zirconate titanate known as PZT has the ability to provide twice the voltage of Quartz under a given force. These transducers are simple, reliable, and very robust, and so find wide use in industry, medicine, and aero-space work. They're unaffected by external electromagnetic fields, and so can be used in applications where electronic sensors would fail. 
They are stable over a broad range of temperatures, but may be effected by long use at high temperatures.
