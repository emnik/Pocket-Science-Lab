# Relative Humidity sensor HS1101
HS1101 sensor consists of a capacitor which varies with relative humidity and is used in a 555 circuit to generate a pulse train of frequency related to relative humidity. The number of pulses over a one second period are counted and the RH is then calculated. 


Based on a unique capacitive cell, this relative humidity sensor is designed for high volume, cost sensitive applications such as office automation, automotive cabin air control, home appliances, and industrial process control systems. They are also useful in all applications where humidity compensation is needed.


Features:

    Instantaneous desaturation after long periods in saturation phase
    High reliability and long term stability
    Suitable for linear voltage or frequency output circuitry
    Fast response time

Key Specifications:

    Power requirements: 5 to 10 VDC
    Communication: Capacative Component
    Dimensions: 0.25 x 0.40 in Diameter (6.2 x 10.2 mm Diameter)
    Operating temp range: -40 to 212 °F (-40 to 100 °C)
    
Procedure to measure Humidity:
HS1101 is a capacitive sensor. This device, when combined with a 555 timer operating as an astable multivibrator, produces a signal with a humidity dependent frequency. To minimize temperature effects, I used  the Texas Instruments TLC555 device in this design.
