### Infra-red Object Sensor
The IR Object Detection sensor module is  made using following components.
- IR LED TSFF5210
- PR (photodiode) BPV10NF
- 1k resistance
- 220E resistance
- 6k8 resistance
- 10k potentiometer
- IC LM358

This sensor is a low cost - low range infrared object detection module that one can easily make at home using IR LED's.
The Main concept is simple, the IR led keeps transmitting IR infrared rays up to some range (there is a potentiometer also in the design with the help of which you can alter the range). 
When some object comes in the (IR) infrared range, the IR waves hits the object and comes back at some angle, 
The Photo diode next to IR led detects that IR infrared rays which got reflected from the object and hence works as a proximity sensor
