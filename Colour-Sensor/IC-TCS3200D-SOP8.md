###Color Sensor TCS3200D-TR TCS3200D SOP8 IC

The TCS3200 programmable color light-to-frequency converters that combine configurable silicon photodiodes and a current-to-frequency converter on a single monolithic CMOS integrated circuit. 
The output is a square wave (50% duty cycle) with frequency directly proportional to light intensity (irradiance).
